## Synopsis

An example crawler for ads.txt files given a list of URLs or domains etc and saves them to a SQLite DB table.

## Usage Example

```
Usage: adstxt_crawler.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t FILE, --targets=FILE
                        list of domains to crawler ads.txt from
  -d FILE, --database=FILE
                        Database to dump crawlered data into
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity (specify multiple times for more)
```

## Targets File 

The targets file can be a list of domains, URLs etc.  For each line the crawler with extract the full hostname, validate it and cause a request to http://HOSTNAME/ads.txt

``` bash
$ cat target_domains.txt 
#https://chicagotribune.com
#http://latimes.com/sports
#washingtonpost.com
#http://nytimes.com/index.html
localhosttribune.com
```

## Installation

The project depends on these libraries and programs installed

* Python 2 or better
* Python HTTP Requests libary (pip install requests)
* sqlite3

Execute this command to install the DB table 
``` bash
$sqlite3 adstxt.db < adstxt_crawler.sql 
```

## Running

The usual usage would be to pass a filename of target URLs and a filename of the SQLite DB.

``` bash
$ ./adstxt_crawler.py -t target_domains.txt -d adstxt.db
Wrote 3 records from 1 URLs to adstxt.db
```

Upon each run a sequence of entries in adstxt_crawler.log is created.

You can examine the DB records created as follows:
``` bash
$echo "select * from adstxt;" | sqlite3 adstxt.db
```
You can clear the DB records as follows:
``` bash
$echo "delete from adstxt;" | sqlite3 adstxt.db
```

## Warnings 

This is an example prototype crawler and would be suitable only for a very modest production usage.  It doesn't contain a lot of niceties of a production crawler, such as parallel HTTP download and parsing of the data files, stateful recovery of target servers being down, usage of a real production DB server etc.
